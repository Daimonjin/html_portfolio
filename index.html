                there were two. I created two of the most basic html websites with the help of Angela Yu's The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy.
            </p>
            <p>The first was a website called "I Pity The Fool", where I ranked my top three Lovecraftian movies.

            <a href="public/movie_rankingsmr.html"><img src="./assets/images/movie_rankingsmr.png" height="200" alt="image link to movie rankings website"/></a>

            <p>
                 The second website was a birthday party invite that listed all the revelent information for the party with a Google Maps link to the location.
